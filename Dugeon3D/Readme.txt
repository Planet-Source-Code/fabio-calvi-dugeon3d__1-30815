This program wants only show the high potential of Direct3DRM
This example don't use 3D Card, use processor; see the CreateDeviceFromClipper command.
I have used Direct X files to create the walls instead of surfaces, following an old 
Patrice Scribe example. 
It looks like having a old Wolfstein 3D or linear Doom view style, but I think it
gives a nice effect, however.
The collision detection is not implemented yet, sorry.
I know there is the Pick command but I am not well documentated about it. 
This is my first program with DX7 Direct3DRM and I don't know it well.
I don't find documentations about it, in my country; the only news I can find about
D3D are in the net.
By the way, if someone wish to send me some informations about it, please email me to:

Thank you, very much.
Happy coding and enjoy, Fabio.
